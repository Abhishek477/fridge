Fridge for codechef freezes your favorite questions and contests, to view them later, when you may not have internet connection. 
It also displays the questions and contests in a mobile friendly format.
So next time, when you are away from your computer, read the questions comfortably from your phone.

If you like the project, **star me**!

We plan to add other languages in our application soon.
